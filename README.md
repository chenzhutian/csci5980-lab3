# Overview

## 1. üé® Color Picker

- **Purpose:** Convert a 3D point in space to its corresponding 2D image pixel.
- **Description:** This sample shows the mapping between 3D space and 2D image coordinates using the Passthrough Camera API. We use MRUK's EnvironmentRaycastManager to determine a 3D point in our environment and map it to the location on our WebcamTexture. We then extract the pixel on that point, to determine the color of a real world object.

## 2. üçé Object Detection with Unity Sentis

- **Purpose:** Convert 2D screen coordinates into their corresponding 3D points in space.
- **Description:** Use the Unity Sentis framework to infer different ML models to detect and track objects. Learn how to convert detected image coordinates (e.g. bounding boxes) back into 3D points for dynamic interaction within your scenes. In this sample you will also see how to filter labels. This means e.g. you can only detect humans and pets, to create a more safe play-area for your VR game. The sample video below is filtered to monitor, person and laptop. The sample is running at around `60 fps`.

## 3. üì± QR Code Tracking with ZXing

- **Purpose:** Detect and track QR codes in real time. Open webviews or log-in to 3rd party services with ease.
- **Description:** Similarly to the object detection sample, get QR code coordinated and projects them into 3D space. Detect QR codes and call their URLs. You can select between a multiple or single QR code mode. The sample is running at around `70 fps` for multiple QR codes and a stable `72 fps` for a single code.

## 4. ü™ü Shader Samples

- **Purpose:** Apply a custom shader effect to virtual surfaces.
- **Description:** A shader which takes our camera feed as input to manipulate the content behind it. Right now the project contains a Pixelate, Refract, Water, Zoom, and Blur effect. Frosted Glass shader is work in progress!

## 5. üß† OpenAI vision model

- **Purpose:** Ask OpenAI's vision model (or any other multi-modal LLM) for context of your current scene.
- **Description:** We use a the OpenAI Speech to text API to create a coommand. We then send this command together with a screenshot to the Vision model. Lastly, we get the response back and use the Text to speech API to turn the response text into an audio file in Unity to speak the response. The user can select different speakers, models, and speed. For the command we can add additional instructions for the model, as well as select an image, image & text, or just a text mode. The whole loop takes anywhere from `2-6 seconds`, depending on the internet connection.


## 6. üé• WebRTC video streaming

- **Purpose:** Stream the Passthrough Camera stream over WebRTC to another client using WebSockets.
- **Description:** This sample uses [SimpleWebRTC](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/simplewebrtc-309727), which is a Unity-based WebRTC wrapper that facilitates peer-to-peer audio, video, and data communication over WebRTC using [Unitys WebRTC package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.webrtc@3.0/manual/index.html). It leverages [NativeWebSocket](https://github.com/endel/NativeWebSocket) for signaling and supports both video and audio streaming. You will need to setup your own websocket signaling server beforehand, either online or in LAN. You can find more information about the necessary steps [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CwJTgt_Z3M)

## 6. **[WebRTC video streaming](https://github.com/xrdevrob/QuestCameraKit?tab=readme-ov-file#-webrtc-video-streaming)**

- Open the `Package Manager`, click on the + sign in the upper left/right corner.
	- Select "Add package from git URL".
	- Enter URL: https://github.com/endel/NativeWebSocket.git#upm and click in Install.
	- After the installation finished, click on the + sign in the upper left/right corner again.
	- Enter URL https://github.com/FireDragonGameStudio/SimpleWebRTC.git?path=/Assets/SimpleWebRTC#upm and click on Install
- Open the `WebRTC-Quest` scene.
- Link up your signaling server on the `Client-STUNConnection` component in the `Web Socket Server Address` field.
- Build and deploy the `WebRTC-Quest` scene to your Quest3 device.
- Open the `WebRTC-SingleClient` scene on your Editor.
- Build and deploy the `WebRTC-SingleClient` scene to another device or start it from within the Unity Editor. More information can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CwJTgt_Z3M)
- Start the WebRTC app on your Quest and on your other devices. Quest and client streaming devices should connect automatically to the websocket signaling server.
- Perform the Start gesture with your left hand, or press the menu button on your left controller to start streaming from Quest3 to your WebRTC client app.

**Troubleshooting**:
- If there are compiler errors, make sure all packages were imported correctly.
	- Open the `Package Manager`, click on the + sign in the upper left/right corner.
	- Select "Add package from git URL".
	- Enter URL: https://github.com/endel/NativeWebSocket.git#upm and click in Install.
	- After the installation finished, click on the + sign in the upper left/right corner again.
	- Enter URL https://github.com/FireDragonGameStudio/SimpleWebRTC.git?path=/Assets/SimpleWebRTC#upm and click on Install
	- Use the menu `Tools/Update WebRTC Define Symbol` to update the scripting define symbols if needed.
- Make sure your own websocket signaling server is up and running. You can find more information about the necessary steps [here](https://youtu.be/-CwJTgt_Z3M?t=1458).
- If you're going to stream over LAN, make sure the `STUN Server Address` field on `[BuildingBlock] Camera Rig/TrackingSpace/CenterEyeAnchor/Client-STUNConnection` is empty, otherwise leave the default value.
- Make sure to enable the `Web Socket Connection active` flag on `[BuildingBlock] Camera Rig/TrackingSpace/CenterEyeAnchor/Client-STUNConnection` to connect to the websocket server automatically on start.
- WebRTC video streaming does **NOT** work, when the **Graphics API** is set to **Vulkan**. Make sure to switch to **OpenGLES3** under `Project Settings/Player`.
- Make sure to **DISABLE** the **Low Overhead Mode (GLES)** setting for Android in `Project Settings/XR Plug-In Management/Oculus`. Otherwise this optimization will prevent your Quest from sending the video stream to a receiving client.

> [!WARNING] 
> The Meta Project Setup Tool (PST) will show 2 warnings (opaque textures and low overhead mode GLES). Do NOT fix this warnings.

# General Troubleshooting & Known Issues

- Some users have reported that the app crashes the second and every following time the app is opened. A solution described was to go to the Quest settings under `Privacy & Security` and toggle the camera permission and then start the app and accept the permission again. If you encounter this problem please open an issue and send me the crash logs. Thank you!
- If switching betwenn Unity 6 and other versions such as 2023 or 2022 it can happen that your Android Manifest is getting modified and the app won't run anymore. Should this happen to you make sure to go to `Meta > Tools > Update AndroidManifest.xml` or `Meta > Tools > Create store-compatible AndroidManifest.xml`. After that make sure you add back the `horizonos.permission.HEADSET_CAMERA` manually into your manifest file.
